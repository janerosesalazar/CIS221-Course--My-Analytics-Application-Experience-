3.1. What are the challenges I experienced in doing EDA, Inferential Regression Analysis, and Regression for Machine Learning?

Throughout the midterm tasks, I faced several challenges while working on Exploratory Data Analysis, Inferential Regression, and Machine Learning Regression. During EDA, I struggled with understanding the dataset fully because of issues like missing values, inconsistent formatting, and outliers that affected the accuracy of my insights. It was also difficult to interpret visualizations when multiple variables interacted with each other. In Inferential Regression, I found it challenging to understand regression coefficients, p-values, and the assumptions required for regression analysis. Translating statistical outputs into meaningful conclusions was especially hard. Meanwhile, in Machine Learning Regression, the challenges became more technical. I had difficulty choosing appropriate features, preparing the data correctly, interpreting performance metrics, and avoiding overfitting. Understanding why one model performed better than another was also something that took time to grasp.



3.2. What could have been the reasons why such an event happened? What are the things I learned that will help me improve?

These challenges happened mainly because many of the concepts, tools, and techniques were still new to me. Real-world data is rarely clean, so encountering missing values, noise, and outliers made the analysis more complicated than expected. I was also learning how to use multiple tools at once, such as Jupyter Notebook, pandas, scikit-learn, and visualization libraries, which added to the difficulty. Another reason was the gap between theory and practice—understanding a concept in class is different from applying it to an actual dataset. I also realized that interpreting results from a business perspective requires a different mindset than simply producing numbers. From these experiences, I learned the importance of thorough data cleaning, checking statistical assumptions, documenting each step clearly, and always connecting technical findings to real-world implications. These lessons helped me understand how to approach analytics more carefully and confidently.



3.3. What do I need to do better next time?

Next time, I want to improve by spending more time analyzing the quality of my data before jumping into modeling. This includes checking for missing values, fixing inconsistencies, and identifying outliers early on. I plan to practice interpreting correlations, regression outputs, and model metrics in simpler and more meaningful terms. I also want to follow the CRISP-DM framework more consistently so my notebooks are clearer and better organized. Strengthening my understanding of regression assumptions and model evaluation will help me avoid common mistakes. Lastly, I aim to improve how I communicate insights by focusing more on the business implications, since this is a key skill for analytics and business analyst roles. By applying these improvements, I believe I can produce more accurate analyses and more professional, insightful work in the future.
